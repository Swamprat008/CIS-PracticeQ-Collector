# CIS-PracticeQ-Collector

READ THE WIKI PAGE, located on top on this page.

This program is a proof of concept!!
I am not responsible for how you use it!!

This Program uses the selenium library for java, it allows your code to communicate with an HTML page.

This program will collect all the questions and answers to the CISWeb practice quiz.
I have included the .jar for instant use, without the need of an IDE.
