# CIS-PracticeQ-Collector

This Program uses the selenium library for java, it allows your code to communicate with an HTML page.

This program will collect all the questions and answers to the CISWeb practice quiz.
I have included the .jar for instant use, without the need of an IDE.

You MUST have the Java environment installed onto your system
If you do not know how to do that then you should NOT be using this system.

1. Download Chrome Driver from https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

2. Put chromedriver.exe in your default Documents folder.

3. Run CIS Web Practice Automation.jar

4. Input your cis.web username and password.

You can change the speed of the program, the fastest speed is 1, default speed is 500. The speed is calculated
in milliseconds.

You can change the amount of times you want the program to run in a consecutive order.
**Recommended: Run it 4 times consecutively, twice. For a total of 8 times, clicking stop after the first 4.

This will allow you the best odds at collecting all the answers.

You can change the name of the quiz.txt file. Example Quiz 1, Quiz 2, etc..
You can change the HTML quiz name, 
Example: qz1, qz2, qz3 etc.. qz1 is Quiz 1, qz2 is Quiz 2, etc..

5. Click start.

Once completed, click the Stop button and then close the program.
On completion the program will create a .txt file and output it in your documents folder.

6. Run CIS Web Quiz Automation.jar

7. Input your cis.web username and password.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
This will use the .txt file that was just created.
**NOTE you MUST type in the same .txt file name as the one just created!
**NOTE you MUST type in the same HTML name as was used to collect the answers.
Example: qz1, qz2, qz3

8. Click start.

**Recommended: stay and visually watch as CIS Web Quiz Automation.jar runs its course, as it may come upon
a question that it has not yet encountered, and will wait 1.5 minutes for you to answer it.
After you answer it, BE PATIENT, it will still wait 1.5 minutes in total before continuing on with the quiz.

**NOTE you can always manually open the .txt file, saved in documents and use ctr + f to find the questions
and corresponding answers.

DO NOT open the txt file while either program runs its course!!!
