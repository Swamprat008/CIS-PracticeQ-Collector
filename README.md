**Recommended: stay and visually watch as CIS Web Quiz Automation.jar runs its course, as it may come upon
a question that it has not yet encountered, and will wait 1.5 minutes for you to answer it.
After you answer it, BE PATIENT, it will still wait 1.5 minutes in total before continuing on with the quiz.

**NOTE you can always manually open the .txt file, saved in documents and use ctr + f to find the questions
and corresponding answers.

DO NOT open the txt file while either program runs its course!!!
